The Big Pile of TODO
============================================5/7/2012
FINISHED-projectile remove on collide-PR+EMR
	+make sure .remove is being called during gameplaystate update


FINISHED-stippled fire rate-PR
	+check button pressing code/checking/look into splicer

FINISHED-turn rate for engines-PR+EMR
	+activate turnrate var for engine class, hook into BasicShip movement code

FINISHED-data structures for ship/item stats
	+entFac constructors need to be simplified, use lookups instead of passing vars
	+5/14/2012::negative, just use methods that return built classes
	+yeah, game Database will have get methods, and hashmaps, the entFac itself is where values will be set
	+5/16/2012::still debugging, making entFac work properly now
	+5/16/2012::entFac properly configured to build any sort of ent needed, but not complete
	+5/17/2012::fixed parts on ship

FINISHED-fix/improve the key handling for input
	+have to handle more than 3 key presses...or something
	+run binary check on keys, see which are counted as pressed
	+5/20/2012:: changed fire to Left_Control

FINISHED--level class architecture-------------------------------------------------------------------5/14/2012: plan
	+start mapping out what a level will look like
	+5/23/2012:: have started the level programming goal, created 3 classes in a new package
	+5/31/2012:: finished, needs refinement
	
FINISHED--mission logic objects----------------------------------------------------------------------5/14/201: plan
	+win conditions, lose conditions, spawners, regions, etc
	+simple messaging system - EntName/TargetName
	+5/31/2012:: finished needs refinement

FINISHED---physics for movement
	+use EMR's email for help

FINISHED-variable projectile velocity
	+look into splicer
	+pertains to things like missile -> early acceleration
	+ or plasma -> velocity trails off over time


FINISHED-properly shaped colliders for everything---------------------------------------------------5/14/2012:implement
	+polygons oh my!
	+custom Shape objects for ships; only ships
	+5/16/2012::make sure everyone has a collider though!

-different projectile sprites/collider experiments
	+can't remember what this was for...
	+wait...collider shapes influences player tactics? hrm, kinda meta right now.

-spawn-kill-die-respawn mechanics
	+start checking on BasicShips stats, death checks, etc


-camera movement
	+look at splicer code
	+hinging on level class architecture at the moment.
	+moved to phase 2

//====ALPHA ONE! :D =======
// 1 JUNE 2012

//============================================================
PHASE TWO
-clean project


FINSIHED-camera, take 2
	+6/12/2012


FINISHED-PWR-'Developer Mode' for render() (nickname: DevGog - Developer Goggles)
	+show colliders, ent names, mouse roll-over support aka proto-mapmaker
	+done - 6/27/2012

FINISHED-an official prototype hud
	+track health, ammo, current weapon....minimap......(!?)
	+just need radar 6/29/2012

FINISHED-FIGURE OUT FUN GAMEPLAY
	+getting close 6/14/2012


//====ALPHA TWO! >:) =====
1 JULY 2012
	+missed :(

//============================================================
PHASE THREE
--in order of priority--

WORKING-stratify triggers and actions
	+8/4/2012 - added multispawnships
	+8/6/2012 - multispawnships works, in a way

FINISHED-nail game over
	+8/4/2012

WORKING-hud: update - add objectives list
	- add radar tags for enemies
	- add radar tags for allies

WORKING-at least one bad guy player can fight
	+AI

WORKING-get objectives working right

-projectile damage types
	+differentiate damage from weapons: slug/plasma/ etc
	+errr sort of

-armor types
	+different armors for different damage types etc
	+ idea: game learns what player uses most
	+ recommended weapons / weapon efficacy
	+ different bad guy colors = different armor types (maybe)

EMR- actual sound effects
	+two weapons
	+two engines
	+explode
	+hit

-build basic menu using framework defined in txt doc.
	+absolutely no artwork
	+try to animate
	+start small

- some music
	+ 1 or 2 tracks

-particle effects
	+engine thrust
	+strafe thrust
	+muzzle flash
	+projectile
	+impact
	+exploision

-finish art for already defined guns
	+6/10/2012 - finished autocannon sprites

-script draft 1

-map out how cutscenes are going to work
	+generic cutscene state
	+interior state-mechanic
	+start/end vars
	+next state targetted
	+make base cutscene class to use which extends basicgamestate

-update optionsEnt
	+move to core, make read a properties file

EMR-player data persistence
	+save class?
	+serialize clientgameplaystate as save file(?)

//====BETA! =======
1 September 2012

Beta will basically be a tech demo, showcasing all the fun things
a player can do in the game. 

//====Alpha blitz====11/25/12
-final sprint towards a workable alpha
-graphics for hud
-graphics for hud mod menu
-graphics / functionality for hangarstate
-functionality for scenario selector
-ai
-scenarios
-items
