The Big Pile of TODO
============================================5/7/2012
FINISHED-projectile remove on collide
	+make sure .remove is being called during gameplaystate update


FINISHED-stippled fire rate
	+check button pressing code/checking/look into splicer

FINISHED-turn rate for engines
	+activate turnrate var for engine class, hook into BasicShip movement code

-fix/improve the key handling for input
	+have to handle more than 3 key presses...or something

-variable projectile velocity
	+look into splicer

-physics for movement
	+use EMR's email for tips

-begin fleshing out specific RedShift package for redshift stuff
	+classes derived from the basicsBasicEnts, entFac

-data structures for ship/item stats
	+entFac constructors need to be simplified, use lookups instead of passing vars

-properly shaped colliders for everything
	+polygons oh my!

- damage type for weapons
	+likewise armor for each

- different projectile sprites/collider experiments

-ship swapping ability for development
	+perhaps start low-level gui code, or just use mapped keys and stock everything

-spawn-kill-die-respawn mechanics
	+start checking on BasicShips stats, death checks, etc

-level class architecture
	+start mapping out what a level will look like

-mission logic objects
	+win conditions, lose conditions, spawners, regions, etc

-camera movement
	+look at splicer code

-sound effects
	+create stand ins
	+load up
	+hook into code


//============================================================
PHASE TWO
-map out how cutscenes are going to work
	+generic cutscene state
	+interior state-mechanic
	+start/end vars
	+next state targetted

-build basic menu using framework defined in txt doc.
	+absolutely no artwork
	+try to animate
	+start small

-player data persistence
	+save class?

-hud

-ammo count

-'Developer Mode' for render() (nickname: DevGog - Developer Goggles)
	+show colliders, ent names, mouse roll-over support aka proto-mapmaker
