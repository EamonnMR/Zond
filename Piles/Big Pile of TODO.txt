The Big Pile of TODO
============================================5/7/2012
FINISHED-projectile remove on collide-PR+EMR
	+make sure .remove is being called during gameplaystate update


FINISHED-stippled fire rate-PR
	+check button pressing code/checking/look into splicer

FINISHED-turn rate for engines-PR+EMR
	+activate turnrate var for engine class, hook into BasicShip movement code

FINISHED-data structures for ship/item stats
	+entFac constructors need to be simplified, use lookups instead of passing vars
	+5/14/2012::negative, just use methods that return built classes
	+yeah, game Database will have get methods, and hashmaps, the entFac itself is where values will be set
	+5/16/2012::still debugging, making entFac work properly now
	+5/16/2012::entFac properly configured to build any sort of ent needed, but not complete
	+5/17/2012::fixed parts on ship

FINISHED-fix/improve the key handling for input
	+have to handle more than 3 key presses...or something
	+run binary check on keys, see which are counted as pressed
	+5/20/2012:: changed fire to Left_Control

-variable projectile velocity
	+look into splicer
	+pertains to things like missile -> early acceleration
	+ or plasma -> velocity trails off over time

-physics for movement
	+use EMR's email for help

-begin fleshing out specific RedShift package for redshift stuff
	+classes derived from the basicsBasicEnts, entFac
	+5/14/2012:: not sure if necessary
	+5/14/2012:: make level package

-properly shaped colliders for everything---------------------------------------------------5/14/2012:implement
	+polygons oh my!
	+custom Shape objects for ships; only ships
	+5/16/2012::make sure everyone has a collider though!

-different projectile sprites/collider experiments
	+can't remember what this was for...
	+wait...collider shapes influences player tactics? hrm, kinda meta right now.

-ship swapping ability for development------------------------------------------------------5/14/2012:simple implementation
	+perhaps start low-level gui code, or just use mapped keys and stock everything
	+5/14/2012::in effect, cleaning up and organizaing the Player Client class
	+5/17/2012:: cleanup begun
	+5/17/2012:: easier than initially thought, architecture is there, but needs refinement
	+error seems to be in passing current rotation down to components

-spawn-kill-die-respawn mechanics
	+start checking on BasicShips stats, death checks, etc
	+somewhat started

-level class architecture-------------------------------------------------------------------5/14/2012: plan
	+start mapping out what a level will look like

-mission logic objects----------------------------------------------------------------------5/14/201: plan
	+win conditions, lose conditions, spawners, regions, etc
	+simple messaging system - EntName/TargetName

-camera movement
	+look at splicer code
	+hinging on level class architecture at the moment.

//====ALPHA ONE! :D =======
// 1 JUNE 2012

//============================================================
PHASE TWO
-map out how cutscenes are going to work
	+generic cutscene state
	+interior state-mechanic
	+start/end vars
	+next state targetted
	+make base cutscene class to use which extends basicgamestate

-build basic menu using framework defined in txt doc.
	+absolutely no artwork
	+try to animate
	+start small

-sound effects
	+create stand ins
	+load up
	+hook into code

-player data persistence
	+save class?
	+serialize clientgameplaystate as save file(?)

-an official prototype hud
	+track health, ammo, current weapon....minimap......(!?)

-ammo count

-'Developer Mode' for render() (nickname: DevGog - Developer Goggles)
	+show colliders, ent names, mouse roll-over support aka proto-mapmaker

-projectile damage types
	+differentiate damage from weapons: slug/plasma/ etc

-armor types
	+different armors for different damage types etc

-update optionsEnt
	+move to core, make read a properties file

//====ALPHA TWO! >:) =====

//============================================================
PHASE THREE
- actual sound effects
	+two weapons
	+two engines
	+explode
	+hit

	+ 1 or 2 tracks

-particle effects
	+engine thrust
	+strafe thrust
